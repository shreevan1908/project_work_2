Regression Model Description – Laptop Price Prediction

🔍 Objective:

The goal of this regression analysis is to understand and visualize the relationship between laptop features (like RAM size, SSD capacity, and customer ratings) and their market prices. This helps in identifying which specifications most significantly impact the laptop pricing.

📈 1. RAM vs Price – Regression Analysis

Model Used: Simple Linear Regression
Independent Variable: RAM (in GB)
Dependent Variable: Price (in INR)

✅ Observation:

The regression line shows a positive linear relationship.

As RAM increases, the laptop price also increases.

This makes sense, as higher RAM generally means better performance and hence a costlier laptop.


📌 Insight:

> For every additional GB of RAM, the price tends to increase steadily. This is a key predictor for price modeling.

⭐ 2. Rating vs Price – Regression Analysis

Model Used: Simple Linear Regression
Independent Variable: Customer Rating (out of 5 stars)
Dependent Variable: Price (in INR)

✅ Observation:

The regression line shows a weak positive correlation.

Higher-rated laptops may have higher prices, but the trend isn’t very strong.


📌 Insight:

> Customer rating alone does not strongly determine the price but may influence it slightly due to premium branding or performance.

💾 3. SSD vs Price – Regression Analysis

Model Used: Simple Linear Regression
Independent Variable: SSD Size (in GB)
Dependent Variable: Price (in INR)

✅ Observation:

There is a clear positive relationship.

Laptops with larger SSD sizes tend to be more expensive.


📌 Insight:

> SSD size is a strong price influencer, especially for gaming and professional laptops.
